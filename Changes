Revision history for Perl CPAN module Lingua::En::NameParse

1.04 10 Dec 2000: Allowed for reversed order names where the surname appears
                  first, followed by a comma and the rest of the name, such as
                  title, first name, initials etc.


1.03 25 Jul 2000: Added suffixes (like Jnr) to most single names 
                  Replaced '=head3' because they don't work with perldoc
                  Removed search of @INC array in BEGIN subroutine 
                  Thanks to Douglas Wilson for these requests

1.02 19 Apr 2000: Removed title J\.? (abbreivation for Judge) as it clashed 
                  with names such as J A Smith, J. B. Jones etc. Thanks to 
                  Adam Huffman for spotting this bug

1.01 15 Apr 2000: auto_clean option now removes commas from input
                  Improved regular expressions in 'clean' sub, thanks to 
                  Mark Summerfield

                  Catered for initials with both dots and spaces, such as 
                  A. B. Smith,  requested by Adam Huffman

1.00 27 Dec 1999: Added user defined file of surname capitalisation over rides
                  Allowed for salutations where precursor is not an estate

0.40 14 Sep 1999: Added the Mr_John_A_Smith and John_A_Smith name types
                  Allowed for hyphenated given names

                  Added the Mr_John_Smith name type
                  Added the John_Smith name type
                  Surnames with the D' prefix now correctly capitalised
                  
                  If a parsed name had no components, the components method
                  returned an odd numbered hash and case_componets returned 1.
                  Both these methods now return undef in this situation
