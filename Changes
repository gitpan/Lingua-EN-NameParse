Revision history for Perl CPAN module Lingua::En::NameParse

1.27 4 Jul 2010
   Changed my cygwin fstab file to use noacl option for default mount points.
   Before this, the tar tool was creating directories with no read permision.

1.26 3 Jul 2010
   Made line endings consistent in all files, with Unix style EOL markers

1.25 2 Jul 2010
   Changed the parse method to match the documentation. It was returning a name
   object and an error flag, when only the flag was required. Note that this
   caused no problem if used as documented, the error value was still assigned
   correctly, and the name object assigned to nothing. Thanks to Chris Prather.
   
   Added 'use warnings' to modules
